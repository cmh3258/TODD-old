TODD
To Do and Discover

Imagine Pinterest. Now take out all the content and replace it with events, food and places in your
current city

Now think of all the web and mobile applications out there that do something life this. 

Yelp, Foursquare, Eventbrite, Eventful, Bandsintown, Facebook, many blogs, newspapers, etc etc etc. 

So many. 

Lets take a handful of these services and push them into one application. 

Allow for a user to add different events, restaurants, food, etc. onto boards that are private, 
shared with friends, family, significant others, or big groups. 

That place you and your girl want to go to that you can't ever remember - saved on yalls board

The food trailer you heard was so good - saved on your board

The baseball game you and your family are going to next month - saved on your family board

Organize your adventures and never miss out on great times 

The ToDo list that is actually fun and helps you discover amazing times

This is the application that wants you to get off your computer and go explore the world with the wonderful people who make it what it is.
